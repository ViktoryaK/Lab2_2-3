You can test the module with the web.json which was attached.


## 2_3

The third task uses all the other files(and web.json).

The main.py is the main module which creates the app. The web_application.py creates a map and other files are just supportive. To run this project it is required to have the hidden.py file with your own keys from Twitter API.
